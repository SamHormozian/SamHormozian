## 👨‍💻 Personal Projects

### Software Development
- **[To-Do List](https://github.com/SamHormozian/To-Do-List)** – A simple web app to add, track, and complete daily tasks.  
- **[Developer Diary](https://github.com/SamHormozian/cse110-sp24-group18?tab=readme-ov-file)** – Team project that followed an industry-style workflow. I owned the Weekly Summary widget (HTML, CSS, JS) and wrote its JUnit tests.
- **[Doorman App](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Doorman-Source-Code)** – Event planning mobile application with residential access control.

### Java & Data Structures
- **[Rock-Paper-Scissors with Inheritance](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Inheritance)** – Console game showcasing Java interfaces, abstract classes, and OOP design.
- **[MyLinkedList](https://github.com/SamHormozian/MyLinkedList)** – Custom doubly-linked list plus JUnit test suite, mirroring Java’s standard `LinkedList`.

### Embedded Systems
- **[File Compressor / Decompressor](https://github.com/SamHormozian/File-Compress-Decompressor)** – Huffman-coding CLI that compresses and restores files losslessly.
- **[Graph Analysis Library](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Graph-Analysis-Library)** – Header-only library for weighted undirected graphs (Dijkstra, MST, etc.).
- **[Medical Image Analysis with Risk Assessment](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Medical_Image_Analysis_with_Risk_Assessment)** – End-to-end pipeline: TensorFlow BNN → ONNX → C++/OpenCV app for real-time inference and heat-map visualization (Docker + CMake).
- **[Skysniff](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Skysniff_Source)** – a sub-$1000 platform that uses a microdrone equipped with a ITAR-free IR camera to provide similar ability to identify gas leaks while enabling indoor operation and increased fieldability.

### Data/ML
- **[UCSD CAPEs Data Analysis](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Group124_WI24)** – Explored links between study time and course satisfaction; implemented linear regression and data-viz with Pandas/NumPy/Matplotlib.
- **[Personal Finance Tracker & Expense Prediction](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Personal_Finance_Tracker)** – CLI tool that logs transactions, visualizes cash-flow trends, and predicts future expenses with scikit-learn.
- **[Sports Betting Predictor](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Sports_Betting_Predictor)** – Flask app that scrapes data, trains a two-layer neural net, and serves NBA/NFL win-probability predictions.
- **[E-Commerce Big-Data ML Pipeline](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Big-Data-Processing-and-Model-Training)** – 25 GB Spark project: feature engineering (Word2Vec, PCA), DecisionTreeRegressor with hyper-parameter sweep, and 4.5× speed-up via smart caching/broadcasting.
