    - [MyLinkedList](https://github.com/SamHormozian/MyLinkedList)
  
      Project consists of a self-made Doubly-Linked List data structure that is similar to Java's built-in LinkedList with self-written tests using JUnit Testing.

- <b>C++</b>
    - [File Compressor/Decompressor](https://github.com/SamHormozian/File-Compress-Decompressor)
 
        This Project presents a robust implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm, renowned for its effective data compression capabilities. Our implementation offers an intuitive and performant way to compress and decompress data files, showcasing the algorithm's utility in reducing file size without losing information. Contains a Huffman Coding Tree class, Huffman Coding Tree as well as both the compress and uncompress files. Showcasing in-depth knowledge of advanced data structures.

    - [Medical Image Analysis with Risk Assessment](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Medical_Image_Analysis_with_Risk_Assessment)
 
      A robust machine learning pipeline was implemented to detect anomalies in medical images, such as tumors, and assess prediction uncertainty for enhanced diagnostic reliability. Using TensorFlow, a Bayesian neural network was trained with Monte Carlo Dropout, while preprocessing large-scale datasets ensured consistent model performance. The trained models were exported in ONNX format for optimized deployment, and a GPU-powered C++ application was developed to handle real-time image preprocessing, inference, and intuitive heatmap visualizations with OpenCV. The project was streamlined with CMake and Docker, enabling seamless cross-platform compatibility.  

    - [Graph Analysis Libary](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Graph-Analysis-Library)
 
        This repository houses a Graph Analysis Library, a versatile and efficient C++ implementation designed to handle undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights. The library provides a comprehensive suite of functionalities essential for graph analysis and manipulation, making it a valuable tool for applications in network analysis, route optimization, epidemiological study, and more. Contains Graph header file and implementation. Showcasing in-depth knowledge of advanced data structures.

 
- <b>Python</b>
    - [UCSD CAPEs Data Analysis](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Group124_WI24)
 
        Group Project involving in-depth analysis of the correlation of amount of time spent by students in their classes and their overall satisfaction with the course and its professor. Utilized the UCSD CAPEs dataset as well as various Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy. Personally worked on implementation of linear regression and graphs using python and various libraries.

     - [Personal Finance Tracker and Expense Prediction](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Personal_Finance_Tracker)
 

       Developed a personal finance tracking and expense prediction tool using Python. The project features a CSV-based system for managing transactions, data preprocessing for modeling, a linear regression model for predicting expenses, and visualizations of income and expenses over time. It includes a user-friendly command-line interface for adding transactions, viewing summaries, and predicting future expenses. Technologies used include Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and CSV, demonstrating proficiency in data management, machine learning, and data visualization.

    - [Sports_Betting_Predictor](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Sports_Betting_Predictor)


      The Sports Betting Predictor is a personal project that combines data science, machine learning, and web development to predict outcomes of NBA and NFL games. It automates the end-to-end workflow, including data collection, preprocessing, and model training using a custom neural network with two hidden layers. The project features an interactive, Flask-based web application, enabling users to select a sport, teams, and game details to receive predictions. Designed as a hands-on educational experience, the project highlights challenges in prediction accuracy and data preprocessing while laying the groundwork for future improvements in model performance, feature engineering, and scalability.

  - [E-Commerce Big Data Processing & Machine Learning Pipeline](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Big-Data-Processing-and-Model-Training)
 
      This project applies distributed computing with PySpark to analyze and model over 25GB of e-commerce product and review data. Executed on a 3-node Spark cluster with 6 cores and 54GB of RAM, the pipeline features comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning, robust feature engineering—including title vectorization with Word2Vec, one-hot encoding with PCA, and price imputation—and scalable machine learning using DecisionTreeRegressor with hyperparameter tuning and RMSE-based evaluation. Additionally, graph-based features were constructed from user-product interactions via "also viewed" relationships. Significant performance optimizations were achieved through intelligent use of .persist(), .unpersist(), broadcast(), and partition tuning, resulting in a 4.5× runtime speedup. This project showcases effective big data engineering and machine learning deployment in a real-world Spark environment.
