<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Personal Projects:</h2>

- <b>HTML/CSS</b>
    - [To-Do List](https://github.com/SamHormozian/To-Do-List)
      
      Project consists of a simple website that tracks daily tasks. The user enters their daily tasks, marks them in progress, and marks them as complete when they are finished. This project uses both HTML and CSS elements.
      
    - [Developer Diary](https://github.com/SamHormozian/cse110-sp24-group18?tab=readme-ov-file)
 
      Group Project that involved development of a Developer Diary using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Elements. Used industry standard software engineering process to plan and execute the development of project. Personally implemented the Weekly Summary Widget's CSS, JavaScript, and HTML elements as well as developed JUnit Testing for it. 

 - <b>Java and Data Structures</b>
    - [Rock-Paper-Scissors with Inheritance](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Inheritance)
  
      Project consists of a simple computer game that plays Rock-Paper-Scissors between a computer and its user. Uses an interface, an abstract class, and a concrete class. Showcasing skills in the Java language.

    - [MyLinkedList](https://github.com/SamHormozian/MyLinkedList)
  
      Project consists of a self-made Doubly-Linked List data structure that is similar to Java's built-in LinkedList with self-written tests using JUnit Testing.

- <b>C++</b>
    - [File Compressor/Decompressor](https://github.com/SamHormozian/File-Compress-Decompressor)
 
        This Project presents a robust implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm, renowned for its effective data compression capabilities. Our implementation offers an intuitive and performant way to compress and decompress data files, showcasing the algorithm's utility in reducing file size without losing information. Contains a Huffman Coding Tree class, Huffman Coding Tree as well as both the compress and uncompress files. Showcasing in-depth knowledge of advanced data structures.


    - [Graph Analysis Libary](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Graph-Analysis-Library)
 
        This repository houses a Graph Analysis Library, a versatile and efficient C++ implementation designed to handle undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights. The library provides a comprehensive suite of functionalities essential for graph analysis and manipulation, making it a valuable tool for applications in network analysis, route optimization, epidemiological study, and more. Contains Graph header file and implementation. Showcasing in-depth knowledge of advanced data structures.

 
- <b>Python</b>
    - [UCSD CAPEs Data Analysis](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Group124_WI24)
 
        Group Project involving in-depth analysis of the correlation of amount of time spent by students in their classes and their overall satisfaction with the course and its professor. Utilized the UCSD CAPEs dataset as well as various Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy. Personally worked on implementation of linear regression and graphs using python and various libraries.

     - [Personal Finance Tracker and Expense Prediction](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Personal_Finance_Tracker)
 

       Developed a personal finance tracking and expense prediction tool using Python. The project features a CSV-based system for managing transactions, data preprocessing for modeling, a linear regression model for predicting expenses, and visualizations of income and expenses over time. It includes a user-friendly command-line interface for adding transactions, viewing summaries, and predicting future expenses. Technologies used include Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and CSV, demonstrating proficiency in data management, machine learning, and data visualization.

    - [Sports_Betting_Predictor](https://github.com/SamHormozian/Sports_Betting_Predictor)
      The Sports Betting Predictor is a personal project that leverages data science, machine learning, and web development to forecast outcomes of NBA and NFL games. It automates data collection, preprocessing, and model training using a neural network with two hidden layers. The project features a Flask-based web application that allows users to select a sport, teams, and game details to receive predictions. While serving as an educational venture into machine learning, the predictor faces challenges in prediction accuracy and data preprocessing, with plans for future enhancements to improve model performance and scalability.
